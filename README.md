# Lens_Binary_CNN
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from a dataset containing 10,000 samples. The CNN is trained to accurately predict whether images belong to distinct categories. With ongoing training, the model supports infinite image predictions, highlighting its robustness in image recognition and classification.
